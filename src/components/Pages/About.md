# Motivation

The [OpenPOWER](https://openpowerfoundation.org/ "OpenPOWER") community needs 
an easy and scalable way to access POWER servers in order
to build a vibrant ecosystem, especially for software developers. 
Docker for POWER (D4P) is a platform to develop
and deploy PowerPC containers within a web browser
(so that users do not need to access to a local PowerPC system).

# Purpose

The aim of D4P is to enrich the PowerPC container ecosystem by providing
both a platform for developers to create docker containers, and for
PowerPC community to find docker images. We have already built and
published over 200 docker images using this platform, and they are 
available both in the D4P's image catalog or accessible through the
C3SR center's [Docker Hub link](https://hub.docker.com/r/c3sr/).  

Users are welcome to use this D4P service to build and contribute their own 
docker containers, which is key to extend D4P's catalog.

# Future Work

D4P is slated to be the hub for the OpenPOWER and PowerPC community to create, discover,
and use docker images.  Future work will provide a page which showcases
work done using container technology on PowerPC. We also plan on adding
articles detailing the best practices to follow while using containers
on PowerPC along with some tips and tricks.
